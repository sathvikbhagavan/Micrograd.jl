# Micrograd

[![Build Status](https://github.com/sathvikbhagavan/Micrograd.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sathvikbhagavan/Micrograd.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is a Julia implementation of [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). 

I implemented it just for fun and understanding how reverse mode AD works. Any contributions on making it better are welcome!
